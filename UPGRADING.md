# Upgrading from 2.0.x to 3.0.x

## New features
- Experimental support for native code acceleration has been added. This currently only supports Linux x86-64 
  with certain AVX-512 extensions. This is opt-in and requires the use of MemorySegment `VectorFloat`/`ByteSequence`
  representations.
- Experimental support for fused graph indexes has been added. These work best in concert with native code acceleration.
  This explores a design space allowing for packed representations of vectors fused into the graph in shapes optimal
  for approximate score calculation. This is a new type of graph index and is opt-in.  JVector 3 remains
  compatible with the on-disk formats of JVector 1 and 2.

## Primary API changes
- `VectorFloat` and `ByteSequence` are introduced as abstractions over float vectors and byte sequences.
  These are used in place of `float[]` and `byte[]` in many places in the API. This is to permit the
  possibility of alternative implementations of these types. This requires changes to many internal/external API
  surfaces.
- Support for indexes over byte vectors has been removed. This is because the implementation
  was becoming increasingly specialized for float vectors, leaving byte vector support as a 
  secondary concern. This specializes many structures that were previously generic over vector type.
- `GraphIndexBuilder` `M` parameter now represents the maximum degree of the graph,
  instead of half the maximum degree.  (The former behavior was motivated by making
  it easy to make apples-to-apples comparisons with Lucene HNSW graphs.)  So,
  if you were building a graph of M=16 with JVector2, you should build it with M=32
  with JVector3.
- `NodeSimilarity` has been removed.  `ScoreFunction` is now a top-level interface; grouping of functions
  for build and for search are now done by `BuildScoreProvider` and `SearchScoreProvider`.
  - BuildScoreProvider allows the creation of larger-than-memory indexes by using compressed vectors
    during graph construction.
  - Reranking is done using `ExactScoreFunction::similarityTo(int[])` rather than with a Map parameter.
    The map change is because we discovered that (in contrast with the original DiskANN design) it is more
    performant to read vectors lazily from disk at reranking time, since this will only have to fetch vectors for the topK 
    nodes instead of all nodes visited.
  - `example/Grid.java` shows how to use these.
- `RandomAccessVectorValues::vectorValue` is deprecated, replaced by `getVector` (which has the same semantics
  as `vectorValue`) and `getVectorInto`.  The latter allows JVector to avoid an unnecessary copy when there
  is a specific destination already created that needs the data.

## Other changes to public classes

- Several methods no longer take a leftover-from-hnsw `int nodeLevel` parameter

# Upgrading from 1.0.x to 2.0.x

## New features

- In-graph deletes are supported through `GraphIndexBuilder.markNodeDeleted`.  Deleted nodes
  are removed when `GraphIndexBuilder.cleanup` is called (which is not threadsafe wrt other concurrent changes).
  To write a graph with deleted nodes to disk, a `Map` must be supplied indicating what ordinals
  to change the remaining node ids to -- on-disk graphs may not contain "holes" in the ordinal sequence.
- `GraphSearcher.search` now has an experimental overload that takes a
  `float threshold` parameter that may be used instead of topK; (approximately) all the nodes with simlarities greater than the given threshold will be returned.
- Binary Quantization is available as an alternative to Product Quantization. Our tests show that it's primarily suitable for ada002 embedding vectors and loses too much accuracy with smaller embeddings.

## Primary API changes

- `GraphIndexBuilder.complete` is now `cleanup`.
- The `Bits` parameter to `GraphSearcher.search` is no longer nullable;
  pass `Bits.ALL` instead of `null` to indicate that all ordinals are acceptable.

## Other changes to public classes

- `NeighborQueue`, `NeighborArray`, and `NeighborSimilarity` have been renamed to
  `NodeQueue`, `NodeArray`, and `NodeSimilarity`, respectively.
