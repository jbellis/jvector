    // Since Astra / Cassandra's usage drives the design decisions here, it's worth being explicit
    // about how that works and why.
    //
    // Astra breaks logical indexes up across multiple physical OnDiskGraphIndex pieces, one per sstable.
    // Each of these pieces is searched independently, and the results are combined.  To avoid doing
    // more work than necessary, Astra assumes that each physical ODGI will contribute responses
    // to the final result in proportion to its size, and only asks for that many results in the initial
    // search.  If this assumption is incorrect, or if the rows found turn out to be deleted or overwritten
    // by later requests (which will be in a different sstable), Astra wants a lightweight way to resume
    // the search where it was left off to get more results.
    //
    // Because Astra uses a nonlinear overquerying strategy (i.e. rerankK will be larger in proportion to
    // topK for small values of topK than for large), it's especially important to avoid reranking more
    // results than necessary.  Thus, Astra will look at the worstApproximateInTopK value from the first
    // ODGI, and use that as the rerankFloor for the next.  Thus, rerankFloor helps avoid believed-to-be-
    // unnecessary work in the initial search, but if the caller needs to resume() then that belief was
    // incorrect and is discarded, and there is no reason to pass a rerankFloor parameter to resume().
    //
